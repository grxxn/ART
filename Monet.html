               [ La plage de Trouville, 1870 ]
               <p>La Plage de Trouville was created during Monet's honeymoon in 1870. On the left of the picture, seemingly lost in thought, is Camille Doncieux, the painter's wife. Next to her, holding a dark parasol and shrouded in dark clothes, is the wife of Monet's mentor, the famed Impressionist painter Eugene Boudin. In keeping with Impressionism's idea of capturing a moment - an 'impression' -in time, La Plage de Trouville encapsulates the fleeting and ever-changing landscape of a windswept beach. The figures, despite featuring prominently in the foreground, aren't given much attention. Both Camille and Madame Boudin lack any discernible features, their faces obscured by the shadows cast by their parasols. Camille's clothing is white and breezy, her hat adorned with flowers. Madame Boudin, on the other hand, cuts a rather stern figure in her all-black ensemble and matching dark parasol.</p>

               [ Woman with a Parasol, 1875 ] <p>Monet's light, spontaneous brushwork creates splashes of colour. Mrs Monet's veil is blown by the wind, as is her billowing white dress; the waving grass of the meadow is echoed by the green underside of her parasol. She is seen as if from below, with a strong upward perspective, against fluffy white clouds in an azure sky. A boy, the Monets' seven-year-old son, is placed further away, concealed behind a rise in the ground and visible only from the waist up, creating a sense of depth.</p><p>The work is a genre painting of an everyday family scene, not a formal portrait. The work was painted outdoors, en plein air, and quickly, probably in a single period of a few hours. It measures 100 × 81 centimetres (39 × 32 in), Monet's largest work in the 1870s, and is signed "Monet 75" in the lower right corner.</p>
